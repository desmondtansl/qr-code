# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is my first ever challenge attempted on Frontend Mentor. I was supposed to re-create an image of a QR code component and this is my solution. Link to the challenge is here: [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H).

The image above is my solution, I've tried my best to re-create as much as I could but obviously there are a few discrepancies with the original image namely, the background-color is wrong, the font family used is wrong for the bolded text portion, the font color used for the unbolded portion is wrong and the border around the entire QR code and text portions are wrong.

Nonetheless, it was a fun first challenge. Will attempt more challenges and hopefully improve my frontend skills.
